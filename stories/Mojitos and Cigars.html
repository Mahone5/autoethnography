      The sixth-grade girls in the neighborhood lead the pack for the morning
      walk to school. I carry my lunch and my baseball glove, no books or
      homework. My father, basically self-taught and strongly against homework,
      says, "They have you for six-and-a-half hours a day, what in the world are
      they doing all day?"

      One thing our school prepares us well for is nuclear attack. We could have
      a nuke dropped on us at any moment. We have regular drills marching down
      to the basement, or getting under our desk. This reminds me of when I'm at
      work in Japan and we get under the desk for an earthquake, like that's
      going to help when the whole building collapses. Sonic booms are common.
      They are loud, and knock stuff off a shelf or sometimes even break
      windows. According to Thomas Jefferson Elementary School, Moscow is a
      similar size and shape to St. Louis, so it's a good place to practice
      dropping nuclear bombs. I write a poem about about the situation. "Ninety
      miles from our shores, lies the nearest of our nation's foes." The island
      of Mojitos and cigars.

      They teach us the three R's. After school, we play baseball, football, get
      into fights, loiter by the house of the cutest girl in our class, and stop
      by this one old lady's house who gives us candy. I'll never forget the
      sound of her doorbell chimes. Sometimes I hear the same chime in Japan.
      Then back home for dinner, and likely to chapel.
    </p>

      We go to chapel a lot, more than any of my friends at school. Our family
      has deep, important, and dogmatic theological beliefs held by almost no
      one else in the world. We distinguish ourselves by calling our meeting
      place a chapel, definitely not a church. Our path is straight and narrow.
      Almost all people outside our little flock are bound for eternal
      damnation, where there is weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth, forever
      and ever. Never ending torture. Not many attend our church in order to
      hear this Good News. For practical living, the mantra is something like
      "Don't drink, don't chew, and don't go out with the girls that do." In our
      church, nuclear warfare isn't nearly as bad as Mojitos and cigars.
